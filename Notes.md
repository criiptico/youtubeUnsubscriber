I just found this link, it's a step in the right direction but it seems it doesn't show the complete tutorial.

Here is another resource that I hope works better. The video yesterday didn't help because of dependencies that weren't 
up to date.

- https://muhammedsahad.medium.com/react-js-a-step-by-step-guide-to-google-authentication-926d0d85edbd

#### _6-16-24_:
So I'm trying to figure out how to use OAuth and I think this video was pretty helpful, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJKUQXmtok
so I'll have to implement that.

Filter YouTube Subscriptions | filteryoutubesubscriptions.com <- get this domain

- The Subscriptions can provide a list of channels through subscription objects
- If you want more info on the videos for a channel, use the Search section
- Here is some sample code to execute some youtube api libraries
 https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client?tab=readme-ov-file

- To identify channel type:
    - Look at most recent videos and its title and description, channel about section. 
    Use this in an AI to identify what type of channel it is. This could be tensorflow with nodejs
     maybe even making an api request to chatgpt to determine how to categorize a youtube channel.

#### _6-13-24_:
Just thought of another functionality. See all the comments you have ever made... I don't think this is a feature on
YouTube but I could be wrong, double check this.
FOUND AN INCREDIBLE PLAYLIST THAT EXPLAINS Google's OAuth 2.0:

Here are some links on how to use react:
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-react-for-beginners/  <- Good for installation and explanation of project structure
- https://dev.to/underscorecode/creating-your-react-project-from-scratch-without-create-react-app-the-complete-guide-4kbc
I think I'll start with the first link unless there's a really good reason to use the second link.
